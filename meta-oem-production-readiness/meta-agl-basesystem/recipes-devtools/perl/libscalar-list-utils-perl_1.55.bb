SUMMARY = "Perl scalar list modules"
DESCRIPTION = ""List::Util" contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed \
would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be \
high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such \
that being individual extensions would be wasteful."
