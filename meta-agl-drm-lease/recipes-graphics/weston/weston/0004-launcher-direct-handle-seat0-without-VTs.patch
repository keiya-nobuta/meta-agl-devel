Subject: [PATCH] launcher-direct: handle seat0 without VTs

This allows launcher-direct to run when seat0 has no TTYs
This checks for a proper /dev/tty0 device as /dev/tty0
does not get created by kernels compiled with CONFIG_VT=n

(cherry picked from commit 72db3ac694c0f84f3c193df42e81be8329e52b61)
